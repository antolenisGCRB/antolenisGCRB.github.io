  <br> <i>Computers are used in medicine for managing patient records, monitoring patients, and aiding in diagnosis and treatment, often with the help of information systems and expert systems.
  They also assist in creating prosthetics and tissues through 3D printing, and in developing customised medicines. </i>
  <br><h2><i> <font color="IndianRed"> Patient and pharmacy records </i></h2> </font> 
 <ol>
  <li> Storing patient information in digital databases. </li>
<li> Allowing for quick access to medical history, test results, and treatments. </li>
<li> Improving efficiency and reducing paper storage. </li>
 </ol>

 <br><h2><i> <font color="LightCoral"> Patient monitoring </i></h2> </font> 
  <li>Using sensors to monitor vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar. </li>
   <li>Sending data to a central station for nurses to monitor multiple patients. </li>
   <li> Triggering alarms for abnormalities. </li>

 <tr>
    <th><b> Prosthetics and Implants</b> </th>
    <td>3D printing enables the creation of custom-made artificial limbs and implants, such as hip or knee replacements. 
     Medical scans like CT or MRI are used to design items that perfectly fit a patient's anatomy, leading to greater comfort and functionality. 
     This method is often more affordable and quicker than traditional manufacturing. </td>
    <th><b> Surgical Planning Models </b> </th>
    <td>  Surgeons use patient scan data to print precise 3D models of organs, bones, or tumours. 
     This allows them to practice complex procedures in advance, reducing risks and improving accuracy during actual surgery. 
     These models are also invaluable for training medical students. </td>
    <th> <b>Tissue Engineering (Bioprinting) </b>/th>
    <td> This is the process of 3D printing living cells and biomaterials (bio-inks) to build functional tissues. 
     The goal is to create tissue scaffolds that promote regeneration. 
     In the long term, this could lead to the printing of organs for transplant, reducing reliance on organ donors. </td>
   <th><b> Customised Medicines </b> </th>
   <td> 3D printers can produce "polypills" that combine multiple medications into a single tablet, with precise dosage and release profiles. 
    This can improve patient adherence to complex drug regimens. Dosages can be tailored to individual needs based on age, weight, and condition.</td>
   <th><b>Artificial Blood Vessels:</b></th>
   <td> Researchers are developing methods to 3D print artificial blood vessels using bio-inks and other materials. 
    These vessels can then be used to replace damaged ones, improve blood flow, or help create more complex organ structures for transplant. </td>

  <br><h2><i> The impact of computers in medicine: advantages and disadvantages <font color="LightPink"></i></h2> </font> 
  <br> <i> The integration of computers in medicine offers a mix of benefits and challenges. On one hand, technology greatly improves accuracy and efficiency. 
   Automated tools reduce human error in prescription and diagnosis, while digital records provide instant access to patient histories for authorised personnel,
   which is critical in emergencies. Advanced tools also lead to better patient outcomes and, in the long term, can prove cost-effective, 
   such as with 3D printing for customised prosthetics. However, significant drawbacks exist. Storing sensitive medical data digitally creates serious security risks,
   as it can be vulnerable to hacking and misuse. The initial costs for implementing technology can be extremely high, 
   and the healthcare system's reliance on these systems makes it susceptible to system failures or power outages. Furthermore, 
   the rapid development of technologies like bio-printed organs raises complex ethical and regulatory questions that are still being addressed. </i>
